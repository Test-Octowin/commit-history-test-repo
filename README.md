This REPO is for testing commit history. 
========================================

The structure of this repo is carefully crafted to expose a few bugs we've had in the past.

The image is a cheesy drawing I made of the various cases we want to test. The green labels are branch names and the little superscript "r" represents the remote tracking branch for that.
